# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

A Flask web application that uses a deep learning model to detect diabetic retinopathy from retinal images.

## Requirements
- Flask
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Python 3.x

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the application: `python app.py`

## Usage
1. Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:5555`
2. Upload a retinal image
3. Get the prediction result

# Detection-of-Diabetic-Retinopathy-using-CNN
Diabetic retinopathy detection with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) involves training the model on labeled fundus images to recognize specific patterns indicative of the condition. Once trained, the CNN can analyze new retinal images, automatically identifying signs of diabetic retinopathy and assisting in early diagnosis.
